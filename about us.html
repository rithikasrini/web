        <h2>Our Manifesto</h2>
        <p>A life of joy is made up of the little things: the fleeting thrill of an approaching get together with friends, the irreplaceable feeling of having your bags packed and ready for a holiday, binge-watching a show with the best snacks (and not much else), and finding a book so good, you slow it down to make it last. At Chumbak, we celebrate these moments that make life worth living. It is these times that the challenge of adulting becomes a little less daunting, and a fun, spontaneous spirit takes over. It is these moments that we savour, and that keep us going. To a life of joy!</p>
        <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
        <p>Typically, the founders and key executives play crucial roles in the company's leadership. Shubhra Chadda and Vivek Prabhakar were the co-founders, and they were involved in steering the company's vision and growth.</p>
